- the company has a dataset of the closed deals in the past two years: 2021 and 2022 and the company would like to know the following:
  - the evolution of the prices in the 3 cities over the 2 years and what are the factors affecting the apartments prices.
  - who is the best salesman among the 3 salesmen in terms of getting the best profit percentage of price.
  - Is campaign Y sagnficantly better than campaign X in generating profit.
  - the charactaristics of our ideal clients to optimize our marketing strategy.
In order to answer these questions I created an Interactive dashboard to show the price evolution and the salesmen Stats as well as teh clients demographics.
I also performed two Machine learning Algorithms using Excel: Regression and K-means Clustering.
# The Data
